# Pacwrap

I started working with Linux many years ago primarily with systems of the RedHat
family. I gave Gentoo a short test drive and still have one Gentoo device active.
When I decided to abandon Windows as my primary laptop/desktop operating system,
I chose Ubuntu because it was a much easier to get a nice look and feel mostly
due to proprietary software not pre-package with Fedora. Sometime in the past
year I moved on to Manjaro an Arch Linux derivative as my primary laptop/desktop.
I like Arch.

I still have systems running Debian, Gentoo, RedHat and Arch families. Although
they share many commonalites, apparently package management will never be
consolidated. I found myself constantl having ot google the correct syntax / switches
for the various package mangers, so to simply my life (and learn more about ruby
and gems) I am wrting this pacwrap gem utility.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pacwrap'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pacwrap

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
